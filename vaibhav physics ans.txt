1) The mean square root of the molecules of the gas is 	
   hence the mean square of molecules of the gas insrease in same properties with the increase in temp.


2) i)atomicity of the gas wether the gas is monoatomic ,diatomic ,triatomic 
   ii)geomatric structure of the gas molecules whether the gas is rigid non rigid or linear and non linear 
   iii)temp. of gas 


3) pv=RT/4


4) A gas which obey ideal gas eqation at all pressure and temp. is an ideal gas no an ideal gas exist in practicle 

5) i)substance which are largely opaque to thermal radiation do not transmitt heat radiation incident on them are know as athermannous  substance 
   ii)a substance through which heat radiation can pass in know as a diathermanous subatance  for a diathermonous body a diathermonous  body absorber nor a
